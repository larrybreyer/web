Dear Tamira:
Thank you for your inquiry and job description for an Oracle developer contract position.  As I mentioned, I am currently employed full time, but very much want to get back into the contract world.
As my attached resume will show I have a broad range of skills and experience.  I am looking for opportunities to focus more on Oracle products.  This opportunity looks very good to me in that regard.  As my wide range of skills would indicate, I pick up new skills very quickly.  You might say computers are second nature to me.
I very much enjoy working with agencies as that allows me to focus on my professional skills rather than job hunting skills.  My resume is intentionally quite long and extensive so that you can trim out areas that are not relevant to your client.  If it turns out the client is not interested in hiring me, please do keep me in mind for other opportunities.
Sincerely,
Larry Breyer
Oracle contractor
