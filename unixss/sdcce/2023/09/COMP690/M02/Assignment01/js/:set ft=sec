This week I learned that although both Java and JavaScript use "dot syntax" and
both languages are considered "C-like", that JavaScript statements do not
follow the Java "convention".  I learned there is such a thing as a "dot
syntax" convention.

I learned that athough both window.confirm() and window.prompt() have OK and
CANCEL buttons, only window.confirm() is correct.

I learned that Comparison and Logical operators are used to test for true or
false.  And, that "!=" is not a logical operator.

I learned that JavaScript has "special" operators.

I learned that JavaScript has an interesting feature that creates a problem.
