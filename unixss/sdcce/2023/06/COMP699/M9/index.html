<h3>//STEP 1</h3>
<pre name="instruct">
Create a string array that contains your five favorite movies. 
Then, use the console to display the second movie in your array.
<code>
    let movies = five_favorite_movies;
    console.log(movies[1]);

<h3>//STEP 2</h3>
<pre name="instruct">
Declare an array called movies using the function constructor method. Add
the length of 5 into the constructor. Then, assign one of your favorite
movies to each index in the array until you have 5 total movies in your
array. Then, use the console to display the first movie in your array.

<h3>//STEP 4</h3>
<pre name="instruct">
Declare an array called movies using literal notation. Then, assign one of
your favorite movies to each index in the array until you have 5 total

<h3>//STEP 5</h3>
<pre name="instruct">
Declare an array called movies using literal notation. Then, assign one of

Copy the code from step 5. Under the existing array, create a new array

regret watching. Display both arrays within the console window so that
it's formatted to look like this (note the spacing, you must include that
too):

<h3>//STEP 9</h3>

<h3>//STEP 13</h3>

Create a multi-dimensional array that contains your 5 favorite movies and
their ranking from 1-5. The array should look something like this:

                 ["Movie 4", 4], ["Movie 5", 5]];

Now, loop through the array and filter out and display only the movie
names. You must use the filter() method and you'll need to filter out the
names by their primitive data type.
<code>
    function checkTypeof(data) {
        return typeof data == "string";
    }
    
    movies = [["Movie 1", 1],

function, loop through the passed in array and display the result so that
it looks exactly like this in the console window:
