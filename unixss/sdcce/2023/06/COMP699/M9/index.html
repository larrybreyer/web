<h1> Summer 2023 - COMP 699 - Module 9 - Assignment 8 - Arrays </h1>
<div>
<pre name="instruct">
To prepare for this assigment, display the Console as follows:
To view the Console, right-click in this window and select "Inspect".
Move the cursor to the Inspector menu bar and click on "Console".
To clear the Console window click on the âŠ˜ symbol.
</pre>
</div>
<br>

<h3>//STEP 1</h3>
<pre name="instruct">
Create a string array that contains your five favorite movies. Then, use
the console to display the second movie in your array.
</pre>

<br>
<h3>//STEP 2</h3>
<pre name="instruct">
Declare an array called movies using the function constructor method. Add
the length of 5 into the constructor. Then, assign one of your favorite
movies to each index in the array until you have 5 total movies in your
array. Then, use the console to display the first movie in your array.
</pre>

<br>
<h3>//STEP 3</h3>
<pre name="instruct">
Copy your code from step 2. Add a new movie into the 3rd position within
your array. Then, use the console to display the length of the array. You
should now have 6 total movies stored in the array.
</pre>


<br>
<h3>//STEP 4</h3>
<pre name="instruct">
Declare an array called movies using literal notation. Then, assign one of
your favorite movies to each index in the array until you have 5 total
movies in your array. Now, use the delete operator to remove the first
movie in the array. Use the console to display the contents of the array.
</pre>

<br>
<h3>//STEP 5</h3>
<pre name="instruct">
Declare an array called movies using literal notation. Then, assign one of
your favorite movies to each index in the array until you have 7 total
movies in your array. Now, use a for/in loop to iterate through the array
and display each movie within the console window.
</pre>


<br>
<h3>//STEP 6</h3>
<pre name="instruct">
Copy the code from step 5. Now, use a for/of loop to iterate through the
array and display each movie within the console window.
</pre>

<br>
<h3>//STEP 7</h3>
<pre name="instruct">
Copy the code from step 5. Using the for/of loop to iterate through the
array, display each movie within the console window in a sorted view.
</pre>

<br>
<h3>//STEP 8</h3>
<pre name="instruct">
Copy the code from step 5. Under the existing array, create a new array
called leastFavMovies. Populate the array with the 3 movies that you
regret watching. Display both arrays within the console window so that
it's formatted to look like this (note the spacing, you must include that
too):

        Movies I like:

        Movie 1
        Movie 2
        Movie 3
        ...

        Movies I regret watching:

        Movie 1
        Movie 2
        Movie 3
        ...
