<h1>About My Father</h1>
<pre>
It has probably been about 20 years since the last time I tried to
learn about my ancestry by searching the Internet.  Much to my
surprise, a lot of historical information about my paternal ancestry
has been added to our electronic history every day.  I found the
Chicago Tribune, a newspaper in print since 1847, has posted images
of all their newspapers, and have digitized some articles about my
paternal ancestors.  I learned that my grandfather, who owned a
couple of taverns around the outskirts of Waukegan, had been the
victim of an armed robbery in 1937.  The robber contested my
grandfather's ownership of one of the taverns.

I found I could now trace my paternal ancestry all the way back to
Germany.  Eight generations back, Johann Shoenfeld, who was born in
lower Silesia in 1675, immigrated to America in 1733 on board the
ship Pennsylvania Merchant.  The ship landed at Plymouth,
Pennsylvania.  His descendants gradually migrated west till my great
grandfather settled in Waukegan Illinois.

My father's mother died giving birth to him, so he ended up being
raised by his grandfather.  My great grandfather died in 1946, 3
years before my birth.  My great grandmother, who I remember well,
lived to 100 years of age.

My father was born in 1925.  He enlisted in the Army in 1943.  He
went through boot camp and school for radio operators.  By the time
he got out of military training the Allies had landed at Normandy
and had begun the march to Berlin.  In order to pay for his military
training, my father signed up for a 6 year enlistment.

My father ended up being part of the post-war occupation force in
West Germany.  His unit was based near Ãœbach-Palenberg, the village
where my mother lived.  While there, in 1946, he met mother, and
married her in 1947.  In 1948,  my father's unit returned to the US
and he spent his final year outside Springfield, Illinois.  Before
his enlistment was up, he transferred to the US Naval Training
Center, Great Lakes, outside of Waukegan, in order to become a radio
operation and repair instructor.

My mother became pregnant with me.  My due date was a few days after
my father's enlistment was to end.  In order to make use of the
superior military medicine of the time, labor was induced and I was
born before my father's enlistment ended.  My birth was further
complicated because Caesarian "C-section" was required.  In those
days, they could not risk a second Caesarian, so my mother was made
sterile so she could not conceive again.  Many years later, my
mother told me she refused to have sex with my father after I was
born.  I guess she blamed him for what the doctors did to her.
