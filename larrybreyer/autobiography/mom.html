<h1>About My Mother</h1>
<pre>
I don't know much about my mother's ancestry.  She told me her known
ancestry went back as far as Charlemagne who gave an ancestral serf
a piece of land which later became known as the village, Übach
Palenburg.  My mother was raised in Übach Palenburg, a small
village, about 15 kilometers north of Aachen, Germany, a few
kilometers from Holland, along the Siegfried Line.

My maternal grandfather owned a couple of movie theatres before
World War II.  One in Aachen, and the other in the family village.
Her parents had divorced and she was sent to a Catholic boarding
school for her education.   Her school was demolished by the allies
before the end of the war.  So, she spent the last days of the Third
Reich in her ancestral village.

Back in boarding school, among her studies was English which she
learned from an Englishman.  I remember she spoke perfect English
with an English accent.  That turned out to be a blessing for her in
America.  People did not suspect she was raised by the Nazis.  They
thought she came from England. This was significant because the
Germans were not very popular in the US after the war.

The Siegfried Line, what the Germans called their "West Wall",
stretched across the German frontier from Holland to Switzerland.
The region of the line near the village was composed of tank
barriers, known by the Germans as "Dragon's Teeth".  That was
important because the people of the village believed it would
protect them from the allied invasion.  It turned out General
Patton's tanks rolled right through the Dragon's Teeth and
demolished their village.

As I was growing up, my mother would tell me stories about the war.
I could tell the war was very traumatic for her.  I could actually
imagine what it was like.  All the men were sent off to fight for
Germany.  Her brother, Hans, was sent to the Eastern Front where he
was captured by the Russians.  Her village had no men.  And, when
the allies came, the women would huddle in potato cellars terrified
at what might happen to them.

She would tell me about the milk cows out in the fields.  She could
still hear their cries, their plaintive mooing because their udders
were filled to the breaking point because no one dared to go out in
the fields to milk them.  Conditions were not any better for the
other farm animals, left in the fields to fend for themselves.

She also told me about the people in the village who had horded
jewelry and precious metals for the hard times that were to come.
And, how they would give away fortunes that look lifetimes to
accumulate for a loaf of bread.

So, I could understand how my mother, despite coming from a middle
class German family, could be attracted to an American GI, and
consider marrying him.
