<h1> Crime and Punishment</h1>
<pre>
My earliest recollections of punishment are associated with my
mother.  I loved to play outdoors.  But, winters in Waukegan,
Illinois, being next to Lake Michigan were pretty harsh.  During
winter I was mostly housebound, and thus, as a male child, a source
of annoyance for my mother.

My mother had three forms of punishment that she used with varying
degrees of success.  The first one I recall was being told to sit in
a chair and face the wall.  Though it was intended as punishment, I
would usually fall into a state of reverie.  Though I did not know
it at the time, many years later I came to realize I was
experiencing the state that is the goal of meditators.  A state of
bliss, if you will, of serene happiness.  I felt I could stay in
that state endlessly if my mother let me.  But, after some time, I
know not how long, she would release me.  She would express anger
that I did not feel contrite.  She seemed disappointed that this
form of punishment did not have the intended effect of making me
feel bad about myself.

I recall this punishment of sitting quietly in a chair, facing a
blank wall, began about the time I started school.  And, despite it
being beneficial to me, did not have the intended effect.  It was
not long before my mother abandoned this first form of punishment.
I suppose she concluded she should use turbulence to assert control
over me.

Thus came the second and more long lasting form of punishment,
threatenting to tell my father, when he got home, of my crimes.  At
first, my mother did not achieve the effect she had hoped.  My
father would come home after a long day of work, change clothes, and
sit at the dinner table waiting to be served dinner.  At the dinner
table, while eating, my mother would accuse me of some crimes
(which, though I may not have recognized them as crimes, I surely
committed the acts that she described).  At first, my father would
shrug his shoulders and say, "Boys will be boys."  But, my mother
was not satisified with that response.  She would nag my father into
action.

So, after dinner, my father would conduct me into the back room of
our house for a trial and the inevitable punishment.  Alone with my
father, I had the definite sense he wanted me to talk him out of
punishing me.  He was forced into an action he did not want, and
hoped I could devise an argument to escape punishment.  But, not
really understanding what I did wrong or why it merited punishment,
I was dumb-struck, unable to mount a defense.

Frustrated at my own inability to mount a defense, I would prod my
father to "get it over with."  Standing before him for what seemed
like an eternity, became more torture for me than the inevitable
punishment I knew would come.

The punishment phase was pretty straightforward.  My father would
order me to drop my drawers, bend over, and lean against a table.
My father would draw his belt from his pants, fold it in half, and
give me several whacks on the butt.  It was enough to redden my butt
cheeks.  I cried, but I was not sure if it was from the pain, my
lack of verbal skills, or the feeling of loss of affection.

After the punishment, my mother would examine me.  She invariably
expressed horror at what my father did and claimed, had she known,
she would have stopped him.   After the 3rd time I heard that, I
began to have doubts about her sincerity.   Perhaps she felt guilt
about using my father to punish me.

I recall in the spring of my 7th year, the stump of a large tree
that had been cut down because it was too close to the house, began
to sprout green willowy new branches.  My father, perhaps
reminiscing about similar punishment he suffered from his
grandfather, took to using these switches to punish me.  He would
cut a fresh branch and strip it of its leaves to administer
punishment.

I recall being hit by the switch was extremely painful.  The switch
would raise bloody welts that I would feel for days whenever I sat
down.  I suppose it was because of the way I screamed when struck,
my father told me, "The less you cry, the less I will hit you."  I
found, by holding my breath and tensing up my body, I could block
the pain.  But, once I had conquered the pain, I found doing so did
not reduce my punishment.  In fact, it seems to frustrate my father.
I felt I had overcome a tremendous source of fear when I learned to
block pain.

Once again, my mother expressed shock and horror when she saw the
damage her executioner did to me.  She would swear she loved me and
would have stopped my father.  But, in the end, she never did
intercede.

When I was nine years old, my father got a job at Camp Pendleton.
He sold the house and we all moved to San Clemente, California.  I
loved San Clemente.  Unfortunately, after about a year in San
Clemente, my father was killed in a joint Navy, Marine Corp
exercise.

It was then the most terrible thing happened to me.  It seems, a
week or two after learning of my father's death, I was running
around the house.  My mother yelled at me and ordered me to stand in
front of her.  She then, for the first time in my life, took a swing
at me.  She tried to slap my face.  I evaded the blow.  My move
infuriated her even more and she ordered me to stand still.  My
father had already taught me to control pain, so I stood motionless,
staring her in the eye as she struck me several times.  At that
moment I felt I had lost both of my parents.

It was not until many years later that was able to see things
through her eyes.  The man she had depended on for her well-being
was gone.  Not only was she suddenly alone.  But, she was also
saddled with a nine year old boy.
