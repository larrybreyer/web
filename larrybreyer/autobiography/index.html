<h3>Autobiograpy of Larry Breyer</h3>
<pre>
I am retired from my 50 year career in computer technology.  I am in the
process of figuring out what I want to do with the rest of my life.  The
following is a manifestation of that process.

I like to think.  And, I find writing is a good way to organize my thoughts.  

I also want to improve my writing skills.  
I figure the best way to improve my writing skills is by writing.  

The easiest thing for me to write about is myself.  So, one way I will practice
developing my writing skills is through an autobiography.  

I have not as yet figured out how to organize my autobiography.  So, as a
first cut, I will organize it into decades.  Here are some recollections about
the first decade of my life, age 0 through 9.
