    <h1>Cancer Staging Q&A</h1>

    <h2>Wow TNM is even worse than Roman Numerals, TNM is not even in alphabetical order. Whose is the keeper of this idea?</h2>
    <div class="question">Wow TNM is even worse than Roman Numerals, TNM is not even in alphabetical order. Whose is the keeper of this idea?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        The TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) system is maintained and updated by several key organizations:

        <ul>
            <li><strong>American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)</strong>: The AJCC is a professional organization that develops and publishes the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, which is widely used in the United States. The AJCC works with a multidisciplinary team of experts to ensure that the staging system is up-to-date and reflects the latest research and clinical practices.</li>
            <li><strong>Union for International Cancer Control (UICC)</strong>: The UICC is an international organization that also plays a crucial role in the development and standardization of cancer staging systems. The UICC's TNM classification is used globally and is aligned with the AJCC system to ensure international consistency.</li>
        </ul>

        The order of T, N, and M in the TNM system is not alphabetical but is designed to follow a logical sequence that reflects the progression of cancer:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>T (Tumor)</strong>: Describes the size and extent of the primary tumor.</li>
            <li><strong>N (Node)</strong>: Indicates whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes and how many nodes are involved.</li>
            <li><strong>M (Metastasis)</strong>: Determines whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The TNM system is designed to provide a comprehensive and standardized way to describe the extent of cancer. Each component (T, N, M) is crucial for understanding the cancer's progression and for planning appropriate treatment. While the order is not alphabetical, it follows a logical sequence that helps healthcare providers and researchers communicate and collaborate effectively.</p>
