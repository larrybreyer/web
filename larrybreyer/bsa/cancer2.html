  <p><b>Q:</b> It is my understanding the disease changes over time.  Are there any models that describe the progression?</p>
  <p><b>A:</b> Yes, there are several models that describe the progression of cancer over time. Some of the most widely accepted models include:</p>
  <h2>**Hallmarks of Cancer Model**</h2>
  <p><b>Characteristics:</b> Sustained proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, evading apoptosis, sustained angiogenesis, activated invasion and metastasis, enabling replicative immortality</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sustained proliferative signaling</li>
    <li>Evading growth suppressors</li>
    <li>Evading apoptosis</li>
    <li>Sustained angiogenesis</li>
    <li>Activated invasion and metastasis</li>
    <li>Enabling replicative immortality</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>**Cancer Stem Cell Model**</h2>
  <p><b>Description:</b> Cancer arises from a small population of cancer stem cells that are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into more differentiated cancer cells.</p>
  <h2>**Evolutionary Model**</h2>
  <p><b>Description:</b> Cancer is viewed as an evolutionary process, where cancer cells undergo genetic mutations and selection to adapt to their environment and become more aggressive.</p>
