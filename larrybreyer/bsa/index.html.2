    <div class="answer">
        The use of Roman numerals in cancer staging has been a standard practice for many years, helping healthcare providers to describe the extent of cancer spread and plan appropriate treatments. The Roman numeral staging system, which uses the numerals I, II, III, and IV, was developed to provide a consistent and clear method for classifying the progression of most cancers. The system was designed to complement the unique characteristics of different types of cancers, providing a universal language for oncologists and other healthcare professionals.
