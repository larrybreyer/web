    <div class="answer">
        The stages of cancer describe how far the cancer has grown and spread at the time of diagnosis. These stages help doctors determine the best treatment options and provide patients with an understanding of their situation. Cancer is staged using a numerical system from 0 to IV, with each stage indicating the extent of the cancer's growth and spread:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stage 0:</strong> This stage, also called carcinoma in situ or "in place," indicates that abnormal cells are present but have not spread from where they started. These cells may develop into cancer at some point in the future.</li>
            <li><strong>Stage I:</strong> The cancer is small and has only spread a little into nearby tissues. It has not spread to any lymph nodes or other body areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Stage II:</strong> The cancer is larger or has spread into nearby tissues or lymph nodes.</li>
            <li><strong>Stage III:</strong> The cancer has grown deeper into surrounding tissues and has potentially spread to nearby lymph nodes.</li>
            <li><strong>Stage IV:</strong> The cancer has spread to other areas of the body. This stage is also known as metastatic cancer or advanced cancer.</li>
        </ul>
        Additionally, the TNM system is commonly used to describe the spread of cancer. It categorizes the tumor (T), lymph nodes (N), and metastasis (M) in more detail.
