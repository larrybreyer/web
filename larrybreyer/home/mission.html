<h3 align=center>Home: Mission Statement</h3>
<p>
This website is the expression of a personal mission.
I believe we are all born with a terrible and wonderful debt.
I believe my generation to be the greatest, the most gifted, of all
generations that have lived to this point. I believe these gifts are
not inherent in us, but that they were given to us by previous
generations. 
</p>
<p>
Thus, we have a debt.
But, it's a debt we can never repay. Those previous generations to
whom we owe this debt have passed. They are gone. So, what are we to
do? 
</p>
<p>
We must do what the previous generations have done. We must pay it
forward. The only way we can repay those who came before us for making
us the greatest generation is to do the same for future generations.
The mission, the purpose of my web site, is to do my
part in repaying that debt. 
</p>
<p>
There is much talk these days about Social Security, retirement, and
entitlements. Let those of us pondering retirement remain mindful that
our job is not yet done. We still must guarantee the next generation
will be the greatest generation. Only then can we consider moving on.
