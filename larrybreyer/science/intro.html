        Science has made great contributions to the advancement of Mankind.
        But, it is also extremely limited in its scope.  The foundation of
        science is observation.  So, its realm is limited to what can be
        observed.  

      </p>
      <p>
        We cannot observe the future. We cannot directly observe the past.
        We can only observe the Universe from a tiny speck of dust.
        We do not even know where that speck of dust is located.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason science works so well is that its main tenant is 
        independence from the observer.  This really means we accept
        something as fact if everyone sees the same thing.
        Though some people claim religion is mass hallucination,
        mass hallucination is the very definition of science.
