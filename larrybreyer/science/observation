Observation


The foundation of science is the idea of "independence from the observer."
If every observer conducts the same experiment in exactly the same way,
he will get the same result.  If the results are not the same, then either
the theory is flawed or the experiment is flawed.  In either case, it is
not science.

The greatest limitation in science is implicit in "independence from
observer." To meet the criteria, the phenomena in question must be
observable. Clearly, the value of science is limited to what everyone
can observe.  How much of the Universe can we observe?

Observation is limited in time, space, and scale.

We cannot observe the future.

We cannot observe the past.  We have concepts like fossilization, but
we are not able to reproduce it.
