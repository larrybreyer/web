The debate over creation vs. evolution is an argument for morons.
They are not mutually exclusive.  Both viewpoints have tremendous value.
Science is limited in that it cannot allow for creation.
This, despite the fact that creation is how we reverse engineer nature.

A comparison of evolution vs. creation.

  Chinese is an evolved language -- it has 84,000 characters
  English is a created language  -- it has 26 characters

Which is better?  Who cares?  
Each approach has strength and weakness.  Let us use both.

The "creation" viewpoint is fundamental to the way the human mind works.
Creation is an abstraction, a symbolism, that helps us wrap our heads
around what would otherwise be imponderable problems.

Example.  The most common utilization of creation is this.

When we try to figure out how 

The most complex problem humanity has taken on is understanding how life works.
We have species made up of genomes made up of chromosomes made up of genes made
up of DNA sequences that produce RNA that produces proteins that are the
building blocks of life.  A useful tool for understanding how something works
is to imagine, "If I were God, how would I go about making this?"

This approach of looking at problems from the creation viewpoint allows us to
create theories to characterize natural phenomena we are trying to understand.

In order to understand an evolved system from an evolutionary approach we have
to be able to see the events leading up to the present time.
Since the past no longer exists, the evolutionary process is impossible.
