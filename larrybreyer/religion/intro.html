        My focus will be on monotheism as it appears to me to be the center
        of the strongest religions.  By strongest I mean a belief system
        people will stake their lives on.

        Religion is all about faith. It is not about being right or wrong.
        The atheist and the agnostic are not right or wrong.  They simply
        don't get it.  And, if you look at their arguments, you will see
        that their arguments are not with God; they are with Man.
      </p>

        About the existence of God:  I hope to convince the reader the entire
        argument over whether God exists is specious and is based on the
        presumption we do not know the limitations of the word <b>Exist</b>.
        But, don't take my word for it.  Look up the great French philosopher
        <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes'>Rene Descartes</a>
        who undertook the simple task of proving the Universe exists.
        How did he fare?  He failed, concluding, "I think, therefore I am."
