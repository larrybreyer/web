        It is curious to me that many people question the existence of God.
        Why is the focus on God?  Why don't we first take a good look at
        the word "exist"? We may find that nothing really exists, in which 
        case the argument over the existence of God makes no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        Surely the Universe exists.  Let me try to prove it does not with
        a simple set of observations.  <br />
        Does the future exist?  Since it has not been observed, it cannot.<br />
        Does the past exist?  Though we can infer its existence, it no longer
        exists.
        <br />
        All we are left with is the present moment.  How long is that?
        <br />
        Until the 20th century, the present moment was defined in terms of a 
        heart beat, the pace at which one walks, or one second.
        That was the limit of how closely we cound define the present moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, in the 20th century there was a scientific explosion.
        Clock increments were no longer defined as a second.
        We now had fractions of seconds.
        In fact, the standard computer heart now beats more than a billion
        times per second.  The present moment is now defined as lasting
        less than a billionth of a second.  Is that existence?
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope at this point, at least in terms of time, we have proven the
        Universe does not exist.  So, what is the value of proving God does
        not exist?
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us look at the Universe in terms of space.  We currently believe the
        universe to be around 30 billion light years in diameter, though it
        most likely is much larger.  A light year is roughly 10 trillion
        kilometers. 
        Our ability to observe the Universe
        is limited to the diameter of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, or
        300 million kilometers.   This means we all observe the Universe from
        exactly the same place.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have no better idea of what the Universe is than the ancients
        who imagined us at the center of a glass sphere.  We cannot
        prove the Universe exists, so we must conclude the Universe
        does not exist. Yet we accept on faith that it does.
        And, so it is with God.
