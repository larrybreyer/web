The idea that what sets humans apart from other animals is self-awareness
comes directly from the idea of God as Witness.

We are not inately self aware.
The idea that someone else is aware of us makes us self-aware.

The fact that we ultimately realize we are our own witnesses is not given.
It is a direct result from a belief that someone else is witnessing us.
Without that, we would not become self-aware.
