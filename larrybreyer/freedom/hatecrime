To declare someone anti-semitic (or racist) is a hate crime.
You cannot know with certainty what is in the mind of another.
A person can declare himself anti-semitic (racist) but no one else can.

Is there an objective definition for "hate"?
I do not think so.  I believe the word is highly subjective.
Science requires independence from observer.
What is hate to one is not to another and therefore subjective; not objective
and therefore not scientific.
