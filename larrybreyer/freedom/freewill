Even though free will cannot be proven, there is one indisputeful fact.
That fact is that you are unique in the entire Universe.
Each one of us is guaranteed uniqueness.
How?  One simple principle guarantees uniqueness.
That is, two objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time.

There is "effective" free will.
No one can predict your behaviour.
That is because no one can know all that you know
by virtue of your unique position in the Universe.

Free will can be determined empirically through elimination.
The proof being that no one can predict your behaviour with 
absolute certainty.

One cannot disprove free will scientifically.
One can approach free will such that the distance becomes vanishingly small.
Though you as an individual may not possess free will, to all observers you do.
