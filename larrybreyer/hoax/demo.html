<h3 align=center>Hoaxes: Democracy</h3>
<p>
    Alexis de Toqueville put it best: <br /> <b>
    <p class='indented'>
      The wonderful thing about democracy is that the people get the 
      government they deserve.

  The Founding Fathers would be rolling in their graves 
  if they could see where Democracy has taken America.
  Even de Tocqueville would be surprised. The Republic
  remains the best form of government.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike the republic where those who lead are accountable for their 
  actions, democratic leadership simply executes the will of the people.
  Democratic leadership is not elected on their ability to lead.
  Democratic leadership is not held accountable for making bad decisions.
  All responsibility rests on the shoulders of those who vote.
</p>
<p>
  We now live in a nation where people are elected to leadership
  based on gender and race.  The electorate does not need to have 
  any investment in this country.  The electorate does not need to
  be able to read.  They don't even need to be sentient.
  Currently under attack is citizenship itself.
</p>
<p>
  The most basic flaw of democracy is the idea that two wrongs make a right.
  The greatest example of that thinking is named "affirmative action".
  Another great example is called "pro choice".
  There was a time when we elected people based on their ability to lead.
  There was a time when we did not punish people for the sins of their
  parents.  Those days are gone.
</p>
<p>
  Even though the only way a nation that is governed by its people can
  succeed is with an educated electorate, democratic leadership has no
  interest in education. The dumber the masses, the easier to lead them.
  Only when you realize the democratic leadership is made up of people 
  who hate this nation does everything they are doing makes sense.
  The method is basic: Divide and conquer.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to see where democracy will lead us, look at India.
  If you want to see the future, look at India.
  Like our own democracy, it is lead by people with a fundamental
  hatred of those who came before them.
</p>
<p>
  Dear reader, we need a new set of voter's rights laws.
  Simply stated, you must have a demonstrated interest in the welfare 
  of this nation in order to vote.  We also need accountable leadership.
