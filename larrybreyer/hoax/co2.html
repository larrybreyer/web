<p>
The theory of Global Warming is based on the premise that carbon dioxide
is a governing dynamic of the Earth's climate.  The notion was expressed
at one time as the greenhouse affect.  I am not sure of the origin of the
notion that carbon dioxide is a major influence in the Earth's climate.  
<p>
I do recall hearing an interesting theory in the 1970s called the 
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis'>Gaia Hypothesis</a>.
The creator of the theory 
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lovelock'> James Lovelock </a>
proposed that life was keeping the climate is a sort of stasis by 
modulating atmospheric CO2 levels.  Life likes to keep the temperature
around 70 degrees F.  But, the Sun is gradually getting hotter.
In order to compensate for the Sun's heating, life is fixing more and more
CO2 to maintain a balance.
<p>
While intriguing, the Gaia Hypothesis ignores something far more fundamental 
to life on Earth.  There is one substance, without which there can be no life.
That substance is what must be maintaining a stasis in order for life to exist.
It would take life on Earth perhaps 500 million years to reach a point
where a Gaia Hypothesis could be achieved.  Something else must have been 
performing that task for those 500 million years.
<p>
The substance that is fundamental to life and governs the Earth's climate is
water.  When one realizes what a remarkable substance water is, especially when
compared to carbon dioxide, it is all the more remarkable so many people
buy the carbon footprint theory.  Just a few of the most remarkable properties
of water are:

<ul>
<li>What substance exists in all three states (solid, liquid, gas)?
Water.  As such, it is the ideal heat transport mechanism for our atmosphere.
</li>
<li>What substance has the highest heat capacity in our atmosphere?
Water.  You may notice that while temperatures vary widely at the centers
of continents, weather is most moderate near the oceans.
</li>
<li>What substance expands when it drops below a certain temperature?
Water.  Ice, rather than sinking to the bottom of the oceans, floats.
Without this property the Earth would be a block of ice.
</li>
<li>What substance reflects more heat from the Sun as its volume increases?
Water.  Higher temperatures lead to higher evaporation which leads to more
cloud cover which prevents sunlight from heating the planet.
</li>
<li>
What substance moves heat from the hottest regions (equatorial) to the coldest
(polar) regions?  Water. Both atmospheric and oceanic currents transport vast
amounts of heat away from regions that have to much to regions that have too
little.
</li>
<li>
What substance is constantly scrubbing the Earth's atmosphere?  Water.
</li>
</ul>

Let's take a look at some major misconceptions about CO2 and climate.
<ul>
<li>
Carbon dioxide threatens life.  Carbon is the most fundamental structural
component to life on this planet.  For the most important life (that which
produces oxygen) CO2 is the primary source of Carbon.  CO2 promotes life.
It does not threaten it.
</li>
<li>
Carbon dioxide is a significant constituent of the Earth's atmosphere.
The Earth's atmosphere is made up of Nitrogen (78%) and Oxygen (21%).
The remaining 1% is made up of Hydrogen, Argon, Carbon Dioxide, Methane,
and others.  
</li>
<li>
Global warming will lead to desertification.  Just the opposite is the case.
Deserts expand during periods of global cooling.  During ice ages water
gets sequestered near the poles reducing or eliminating rainfall in
equatorial regions.  Whereas during periods of global warming there is
evidence of tropical conditions existing from pole to pole (the entier globe).
</li>
</ul>
In closing, I would like to suggest Global Warming, though dislocating
for some, will on balance be exactly what the human race needs. 
We are running out of two very important requirements for human life.
They are fresh water and food.  A warmer climate will lead to more rainfall
and therefore more life-sustaining water.  There are millions of square
miles of arable land currently locked up in tundra.  Melting of the polar
caps would greatly expand the temperate zones and the land available for
cultivation.  Global warming will be wonderful.
