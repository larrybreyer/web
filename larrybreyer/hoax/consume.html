<p>
In the latter half of the 20th century a rather insane idea became prevalent in
America.  It was widely held that America's role in the World is to consume.
That by consuming goods we were creating jobs for the rest of humanity.
That without US, the World would suffer widespread unemployment.
</p>
<p>
I cannot begin to fathom the rationale of this type of insanity.
Is it based on the premise that the rest of the World does not or cannot
consume?  We must appear completely insane to the rest of the World.
Every country has farmers who raise animals whose entire role in life is to
consume, until they themselves are consumed.  Is America a nation of pigs?
</p>
<p>
Consumerism is on the same level as the idea that the World loves America.
Consumerism is comparable to the insanity of appeasement.
</p>
<p>
In reality, America is only of value to the rest of the World as long as
it provides benefits no other country is capable of providing.  As soon
as the other nations of the World learn ways to live better without America, 
America becomes redundant.  Coupled with consumerism, the future of America
looks extremely bleak.

Though a bit over the top, <a href="http://www.zcommunications.org/fundamentalist-consumerism-and-an-insane-society-by-bruce-e-levine">Bruce E. Levine</a>
makes some excellent points on the subject.
