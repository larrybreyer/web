Theories provide an important starting point in the quest for knowledge
when delving into unknown territory.  But, there arises on occasion ideas
at are so outlandish they must be confronted.  In the "Hoax" section I
hope to dispel some of the most outlandish notions.

<p>
I found this quote in the opening title of Mel Gibson's Apocalypto:<p>
<b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"A great civilization is not conquered from without 
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
until it has destroyed itself from within." W. Durant 
</b>
</p>
<p>
Number one on the list is Global Warming.
I do not dispute whether or not the Earth's climate is warming.  
Nobody knows.
But, I do dispute the notion that carbon dioxide is the governing
dynamic in the Earth's climate.  
I hope to convince the reader to exert
some independence with regard to this "theory".
</p>
<p>
Next I explore another form of global insanity started in America,
Consumerism.  Based on the ridiculous premise that we can consume
our way to prosperity, neither capitalism nor communism provide a
solution.  Perhaps we can save ourselves through religion?
