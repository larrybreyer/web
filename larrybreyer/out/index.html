  <h2 class="chapter-title">Introduction</h2>
  <div class="chapter-text">
    <p>The Purpose of this book is to chronical the rise in Anti-American activity
inside and outside the US since the fall of the Soviet Union.
While, Anti-American sentiment has existed since the inception of the 
United States of America, it was largely repressed within the US by 
external threats.  And, like all great nations, once the external threats
are eliminated, the internal threats are free to begin their subversive
activity.  Those internal threats include, but are not limited to, 
collaborating with enemies of the US.</p>
<p>The most important feature of subversion is mis-information.  One very good
example of that, is while subversives in the US were collaborating with
Arab radicals to destroy the World Trade Center, they also embarked on a
dis-information campaign to depict the US leadership as co-conspirators.</p>

  <h2 class="chapter-title">What is Black Culture?</h2>
  <div class="chapter-text">
    <p>If you wanted to subvert a country, where would you recruit?</p>
<p>Black Culture was invented in the 1960s by a new American religion,
Black Muslim, whose origin was the American prison system.
The timing was coincident with the peak of the Cold War
at which time, the Soviet Union and Communist China had achieved the
maximum influence, by invasion and subversion, of the World.
The Blacks recognized this was America at its weakest and thus their
best opportunity to subvert and undermine American culture.</p>

    <p>One of the most important speeches made by an American leader was the farewell
speech of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.  In that speech, he warned of the
rise of big government bureaucracies and how they would undermine America.</p>

  <h2 class="chapter-title">What is DoubleSpeak?</h2>
  <div class="chapter-text">
    <p>A plank of the subversive platform is destruction of language.
Create confusion among the opposition by re-defining words used
to communicate laws and ideals. Among the elements of subverting
a language is ambiguity.  Black culture ambiguates the definition
of &quot;black&quot;  my mixing race with culture.  Though &quot;black&quot; has nothing
to do with race, the ambiguity is used to confuse issues.  Though
adherents of Black culture exclaim they want to fight racism, they
are the most racist of all cultures in America.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, when subversives discovered they could undermine America,
by convincing women that should have the right to abortions, they quickly
discovered the images abortion invokes.  They changed &quot;abortion rights&quot;
to &quot;pro-choice&quot;, apparently fooling people into thing &quot;pro-choice&quot; was
the end of the story.  But, &quot;pro-choice&quot; really means pro euthenasia
while in the womb.  Or, a simpler definition is &quot;pro-murder&quot;.</p>
<p>The &quot;Pro-Choice&quot; is trivial compared to the &quot;Affordable Care Act&quot;.
The ACA is an attempt by the Democrats to double-down on the crime
they perpetrated against America during the World War II power grab.
Realizing they had triggered a wage-price inflation spiral by
starting a massive war with Japan, they instituted wage-price controls.
They passed laws to prevent wage increases across America.
When that turned out to prevent the war industry from ramping up,
they allowed war industries to offer &quot;perks&quot; in lieu of salary to attract
labor.  Among the perks was employer sponsored health care.
The Democrats gave their cronies in business a tax break for the perks.
This was the first step in government subsidized health care.
This was the first step in uncontrolled increases in health care costs
that lead to the Democrats&#39; first crisis of the 21st century,
unaffordable health care.  Thus, their solution, the &quot;Affordable Care Act.&quot;
Now, instead of subsidizing businesses directly, the Democrats
will directly subsidize their cronies in the Health Insurance industry.
Health care costs continue to spiral out of control, and out of reach
of all but the richest Americans.  How does the Affordable Care Act work?
The Democrats have allowed their cronies in the Health Insurance industry
to create outrages &quot;deductibles&quot; that guarantee, in addition to outrages
premiums, they will not have to pay for any of the liablities they are
supposed to assume.</p>

  <h2 class="chapter-title">Are Democrats Stupid?</h2>
  <div class="chapter-text">
    <p>Why do the Democrats get such different results from what they promote?
They decide to allow people who cannot afford to buy a home, do just that.
The result was a collapse of the banking system.
Do they really believe the collapse was the result of some diabolic plan
by the banking industry?  Are they stupid?  Perhaps, when they have some
pie in the sky idea, they actually think it will work. And, when it fails,
the logical reason in their minds, is some diabolical conspiracy by the rich,
the conservatives, businesses, the Tea Party, or oil men.</p>
<p>Why do the Democrats have a war on poverty?  Don&#39;t they realize poverty is
relative?  The &quot;war on poverty&quot; is an never-ending assault on people who
work in order to earn things. Are they stupid?  Or, is this a thinly vailed
crime against America?</p>
<p>Why do the Democrats promote legislation invented by academics?
Do the Democrats really have some love affair with Academia?
The Democrats represent the losers of America, not the winners.
The Democrats represent the stupid people in America.
The real question is, what kind of representation do stupid people deserve?</p>

  <h2 class="chapter-title">Goverment vs. Corporate Welfare</h2>
  <div class="chapter-text">
    <p>There really is not much difference, except one.
Corporate welfare works, but government welfare fails.
The reason is simple.  It is business interests (Republicans) who
facilitate corporate welfare. The Democrats, imitating business (like the pigs
in George Orwell&#39;s &quot;Animal Farm&quot;), who implement government welfare.
While businesses can modify and adapt their welfare system, 
it seems government cannot.</p>

  <h2 class="chapter-title">Outside the United States</h2>
  <div class="chapter-text">
    <p>The source of Anti-Americanism overseas should pretty obvious.
The US is the richest and most powerful nation in world history.
But, there is more.  The biggest gripe about America is that is
very existence makes the rest of the world look bad.</p>
<p>Why does the US get attacked?  For the same reason the Reagan administration
faced down the USSR.  It is not enough to be the strongest to prevent being
attacked.  You must also be the strongest in the mind of those who would
do harm.  Every time the US has been attacked it was due to a perception
of weakness.</p>
<p>The Democrats are appeasers.  What the previous paragrpah demostrates is that 
appeasement invites attack.</p>
