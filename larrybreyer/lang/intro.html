        People have been trying for over 100 years to identify the
        differences between the races. Conclusion to date is that there
        are none.

      <p>
        So, the only significant difference between people is culture.
        Culture is inextricably bonded with language. Thus, it is
        language that makes the difference in what we are. Without
        language there is no culture and thus no uniting force to lead
        to what makes humans great, their ability to specialize and
        cooperate.

      <p>
        Because I see a profound importance in language, I see a great
        threat from those who would undermine, bastardize, or ambiguate
        a language. In fact, I believe the most effective way to
        destroy a people is to destroy their culture. Language is where
        a culture is most vulnerable. 

      <p>
        That is not to say all cultures are equal. There is ample
        evidence to show that all cultures are not equal. Look at laws,
        religion, science, and you will see vast differences in
        cultures.
