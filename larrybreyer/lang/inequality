One of the great achievements of humans is specialization.
Specialization is fundamental inequality.
Thus, there are fundamental advantages to inequality.
And, the blind effort to make everyone equal is fundamentally flawed
and extremely destructive.

On win-win

The oldest rule is lose-lose and is based on the law of retaliation.
It has a fundamental flaw in that it is based on the premise that 
two wrongs make a right.

More modern is win-lose/lose-win, or zero sum game.
Slightly more advanced than lose-lose it adds the idea of balance,
eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, life for a life.
Though better than lose-lose, and an excellent rule for accouting,
still fundamentally flawed.

The most modern idea, voiced by Adam Smith, win-win results in
as he said, "The best of all possible worlds."  Nothing since
has improved upon that idea.
